Background: Researchers are generating molecular data pertaining to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome and its proteins at an unprecedented rate during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, there is a critical need for rapid and continuously updated access to the latest molecular data in a format in which all data can be quickly cross-referenced and compared. We adapted our genome browser visualization tool to the viral genome for this purpose. Molecular data, curated from published studies or from database submissions, are mapped to the viral genome and grouped together into ""annotation tracks"" where they can be visualized along the linear map of the viral genome sequence and programmatically downloaded in standard format for analysis. Results: The UCSC Genome Browser for SARS-CoV-2 (https://genome.ucsc.edu/covid19.html) provides continuously updated access to the mutations in the many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes deposited in GISAID and the international nucleotide sequencing databases, displayed alongside phylogenetic trees. These data are augmented with alignments of bat, pangolin, and other animal and human coronavirus genomes, including per-base evolutionary rate analysis. All available annotations are cross-referenced on the virus genome, including those from major databases (PDB, RFAM, IEDB, UniProt) as well as up-to-date individual results from preprints. Annotated data include predicted and validated immune epitopes, promising antibodies, RT-PCR and sequencing primers, CRISPR guides (from research, diagnostics, vaccines, and therapies), and points of interaction between human and viral genes. As a community resource, any user can add manual annotations which are quality checked and shared publicly on the browser the next day. Conclusions: We invite all investigators to contribute additional data and annotations to this resource to accelerate research and development activities globally. Contact us at genome-www@soe.ucsc.edu with data suggestions or requests for support for adding data. Rapid sharing of data will accelerate SARS-CoV-2 research, especially when researchers take time to integrate their data with those from other labs on a widely-used community browser platform with standardized machine-readable data formats, such as the SARS-CoV-2 Genome Browser.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.04.075945v1.full.pdf

SARS-CoV-2 invades host cells via an endocytic pathway that begins with the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (S-protein) and human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Genetic variability in ACE2 may be one factor that mediates the broad-spectrum severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 outcomes. We investigated the capacity of ACE2 variation to influence SARS-CoV-2 infection with a focus on predicting the effect of missense variants on the ACE2 SARS-CoV-2 S-protein interaction. We validated the mCSM-PPI2 variant effect prediction algorithm with 26 published ACE2 mutant SARS-CoV S-protein binding assays and found it performed well in this closely related system (True Positive Rate = 0.7, True Negative Rate = 1). Application of mCSM-PPI2 to ACE2 missense variants from the Genome Aggregation Consortium Database (gnomAD) identified three that are predicted to strongly inhibit or abolish the S-protein ACE2 interaction altogether (p.Glu37Lys, p.Gly352Val and p.Asp355Asn) and one that is predicted to promote the interaction (p.Gly326Glu). The S-protein ACE2 inhibitory variants are expected to confer a high degree of resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection whilst the S-protein ACE2 affinity enhancing variant may lead to additional susceptibility and severity. We also performed in silico saturation mutagenesis of the S-protein ACE2 interface and identified a further 38 potential missense mutations that could strongly inhibit binding and one more that is likely to enhance binding (Thr27Arg). A conservative estimate places the prevalence of the strongly protective variants between 12-70 per 100,000 population but there is the possibility of higher prevalence in local populations or those underrepresented in gnomAD. The probable interplay between these ACE2 affinity variants and ACE2 expression polymorphisms is highlighted as well as gender differences in penetrance arising from ACE2's situation on the X-chromosome. It is also described how our data can help power future genetic association studies of COVID-19 phenotypes and how the saturation mutant predictions can help design a mutant ACE2 with tailored S-protein affinity, which may be an improvement over a current recombinant ACE2 that is undergoing clinical trial.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.03.074781v1.full.pdf

Here we present the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) covalently bound to 2-methyl-1-tetralone. This complex was obtained by co-crystallization of Mpro with HEAT (2-(((4-hydroxyphenethyl)amino)methyl)-3,4-dihydronaphthalen-1(2H)-one) in the framework of a large X-ray crystallographic screening project of Mpro against a drug repurposing library, consisting of 5632 approved drugs or compounds in clinical phase trials. Further investigations showed that HEAT is cleaved by Mpro in an E1cB-like reaction mechanism into 2-methylene-1-tetralone and tyramine. The catalytic Cys145 subsequently binds covalently in a Michael addition to the methylene carbon atom of 2-methylene-1-tetralone. According to this postulated model HEAT is acting in a pro-drug-like fashion. It is metabolized by Mpro, followed by covalent binding of one metabolite to the active site. The structure of the covalent adduct elucidated in this study opens up a new path for developing non-peptidic inhibitors.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.02.043554v1.full.pdf

The COVID-19 pandemic, attributed to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection, resulted in millions infected worldwide and an immediate need for antiviral treatments. The main protease (Mpro) in SARS-CoV-2 is a viable drug target because of its essential role in the cleavage of the virus polypeptide and subsequent viral replication. Feline infectious peritonitis, a fatal infection in cats caused by a coronavirus, was successfully treated previously with a dipeptide-based protease inhibitor. Here we show this drug, GC376, and its analog GC373, are effective inhibitors of the Mpro from both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with IC50 values in the nanomolar range. Crystal structures of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with these inhibitors have a covalent modification of the nucleophilic Cys145. NMR analysis reveals that inhibition proceeds via reversible formation of a hemithioacetal. GC373 and GC376 are potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture, with EC50 values near one micromolar and little to no toxicity. These protease inhibitors are soluble, non-toxic, and bind reversibly. They are strong drug candidates for the treatment of human coronavirus infections because they have already been successful in animals (cats). The work here lays the framework for their use in human trials for the treatment of COVID-19.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.03.073080v1.full.pdf

The COVID-19 pandemic imposed not only serious threats to the physical health of the population, but also provoked a wide range of psychological problems. Objective: to identify the most vulnerable populations during the epidemic period (including among individuals with affective disorders) who are most in need of psychological and / or psychiatric help. Material and methods: on-line survey of 1957 Russian-speaking respondents over 18 years old from March 30 to April 5, 2020. The level of anxiety distress was verified with the psychological stress scale (PSM-25). Stigmatization of individuals experiencing respiratory symptoms was assessed with modified devaluation / discrimination questionnaire (PDD; Cronbach's Œ±= 0.707). Results: 99.8% of respondents had variable concerns associated with COVID-19. Their mean scores of psychological stress were increased to moderate levels (104.9 ¬± 34.4 points), and the stigmatization scores exceeded the value of the whole sample median (19.5 ¬± 3.4; Me = 19). 35% of respondents had concerns about COVID-19 associated with anxiety distress (Cohen's d = 0.16-0.39). These were ""risk of isolation"" and ""possible lack of medication for daily use"". The most prone to concerns were respondents' groups with affective disorders; young people (‚â?0 years old), unemployed, single, those without higher education and women. Conclusions: large sub-cohorts of the Russian-speaking sample need correction of anxiety distress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The implementation of such measures should be targeted and oriented in terms of coverage and content to identified vulnerable social groups.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.28.20074302v1.full.pdf

We have developed a reverse-transcriptase loop mediated amplification (RT-LAMP) method targeting genes encoding the Spike (S) protein and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) of SARS-CoV-2. The LAMP assay achieves the same limit of detection as commonly used RT-PCR protocols based on artificial targets, recombinant Sindbis virus, and clinical samples. Clinical validation of single target LAMP (N=108) showed a positive percent agreement (PPA) of 33/34 (97.1%) and negative percent agreement (NPA) of 73/74 (98.6%) compared to reference RT-PCR. Dual target RT-LAMP achieved a PPA of 11/11 (100%) and NPA 13/13 (100%) when including discrepant samples. The assay can be performed without a formal extraction procedure, with lyophilized reagents that do need cold chain, and is amenable to point-of-care application with visual detection.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.29.20075747v1.full.pdf

BACKGROUND Since the confirmation of the first patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Spain in January 2020, the epidemic has grown rapidly, with the greatest impact on the Madrid region. This article describes the first 2226 consecutive adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to the La Paz University Hospital in Madrid. METHODS Our cohort included all consecutively admitted patients who were hospitalized and who had a final outcome (death or discharge) in a 1286-bed hospital of Madrid (Spain) from February 25th (first case admitted) to April 19th, 2020. Data was entered manually into an electronic case report form, which was monitored prior to the analysis. RESULTS We consecutively included 2226 adult patients admitted to the hospital who either died (460) or were discharged (1766). The patients median age was 61 years; 51.8% were women. The most common comorbidity was arterial hypertension (41.3%). The most common symptoms on admission were fever (71.2%). The median time from disease onset to hospital admission was 6 days. Overall mortality was 20.7% and was higher in men (26.6% vs 15.1%). Seventy-five patients with a final outcome were transferred to the ICU (3.4%). Most patients admitted to the ICU were men, and the median age was 64 years. Baseline laboratory values on admission were consistent with an impaired immune-inflammatory profile. CONCLUSIONS We provide a description of the first large cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Europe. Advanced age, male gender, the presence of comorbidities and abnormal laboratory values were more common among the patients with fatal outcomes.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.29.20080853v1.full.pdf

Introduction: The Chasing COVID Cohort (C3) study is a US-based, geographically and socio-demographically diverse sample of adults (18 and older) enrolled into a prospective cohort study during the upswing of the U.S. COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We used internet-based strategies to enroll C3 participants beginning March 28th, 2020. Following baseline questionnaire completion, study participants will be contacted monthly (for 6 months) to complete assessments of engagement in non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., use of cloth masks, avoiding large gatherings); COVID-19 symptoms; SARS/COV2 testing and diagnosis; hospitalizations; healthcare access; and uptake of health messaging. Dried blood spot (DBS) specimens will be collected at the first follow-up assessment (last week of April 2020) and at month 3 (last week of June 2020) and stored until a validated serologic test is available. Results: As of April 20, 2020, the number of people that completed the baseline survey and provided contact information for follow-up was 7,070. Participants resided in all 50 US states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam. At least 24% of participants were frontline workers (healthcare and other essential workers). Twenty-three percent (23%) were 60+ years, 24% were Black or Hispanic, 52% were men, and 52% were currently employed. Nearly 20% reported recent COVID-like symptoms (cough, fever or shortness of breath) and a high proportion reported engaging in non-pharmaceutical interventions that reduce SARS/COV2 spread (93% avoided groups >20, 58% wore masks; 73% quarantined). More than half (54%) had higher risk for severe COVID-19 illness should they become infected with SARS/COV2 based on age, underlying health conditions (e.g., chronic lung disease), or daily smoking. Discussion: A geographically and socio-demographically diverse group of participants was rapidly enrolled in the C3 during the upswing of the SARS/COV2 pandemic. Strengths of the C3 include the potential for direct observation of, and risk factors for, seroconversion and incident COVID disease (among those with or without antibodies to SARS/COV2) in areas of active transmission.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.28.20080630v1.full.pdf

Vigorous non-pharmaceutical interventions have largely suppressed the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China. We developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to study the transmission dynamics and evaluate the impact of interventions using 32,583 laboratory-confirmed cases from December 8, 2019 till March 8, 2020, accounting for time-varying ascertainment rates, transmission rates, and population movements. The effective reproductive number R0 dropped from 3.89 (95% credible interval: 3.79-4.00) before intervention to 0.14 (0.11-0.28) after full-scale multi-pronged interventions. By projection, the interventions reduced the total infections in Wuhan by 96.5% till March 8. Furthermore, we estimated that 79% (lower bound: 60%) of the total infections were unascertained, potentially including asymptomatic and mild-symptomatic cases. The probability of resurgence was 0.22 and 0.10 based on models with 79% and 60% infections unascertained, respectively, assuming interventions were lifted after a 14-day period of no new ascertained infections. These results provide important implications for continuing surveillance and interventions to eventually contain the outbreak.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.27.20078436v1.full.pdf

Background Effective therapies are urgently needed for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Chloroquine has been proved to have antiviral effect against coronavirus in vitro. In this study, we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of chloroquine with different doses in COVID-19. Method In this multicenter prospective observational study, we enrolled patients older than 18 years old with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection excluding critical cases from 12 hospitals in Guangdong and Hubei Provinces. Eligible patients received chloroquine phosphate 500mg, orally, once (half dose) or twice (full dose) daily. Patients treated with non-chloroquine therapy were included as historical controls. The primary endpoint is the time to undetectable viral RNA. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of patients with undetectable viral RNA by day 10 and 14, hospitalization time, duration of fever, and adverse events. Results A total of 197 patients completed chloroquine treatment, and 176 patients were included as historical controls. The median time to achieve an undetectable viral RNA was shorter in chloroquine than in non-chloroquine (absolute difference in medians -6.0 days; 95% CI -6.0 to -4.0). The duration of fever is shorter in chloroquine (geometric mean ratio 0.6; 95% CI 0.5 to 0.8). No serious adverse events were observed in the chloroquine group. Patients treated with half dose experienced lower rate of adverse events than with full dose. Conclusions Although randomised trials are needed for further evaluation, this study provides evidence for safety and efficacy of chloroquine in COVID-19 and suggests that chloroquine can be a cost-effective therapy for combating the COVID-19 pandemic.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.26.20081059v1.full.pdf

Background Serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies is needed to document the community prevalence and distribution of the virus, particularly since many individuals have mild symptoms and cannot access molecular diagnostic testing of naso-pharyngeal swabs. However, the requirement for serum/plasma limits serological testing to clinical settings where it is feasible to collect and process venous blood. To address this problem we developed a serological test for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies that requires only a single drop of capillary whole blood, collected from a simple finger prick and dried on filter paper (dried blood spot, DBS). Methods Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was optimized to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. DBS samples were eluted overnight and transferred to a 96-well plate coated with antigen, and anti-human IgG-HRP was used to generate signal in proportion to bound antibody. DBS samples spiked with anti-SARS IgG antibody, and samples from known positive and negative cases, were compared to evaluate assay performance. Results Analysis of samples with known concentrations of anti-SARS IgG produced the expected pattern of dose-response. Optical density (OD) values were significantly elevated for known positive cases in comparison with samples from unexposed individuals. Discussion DBS ELISA provides a minimally-invasive alternative to venous blood collection that combines the convenience of sample collection in the home or non-clinical setting with the accuracy of ELISA in the lab. Serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in DBS samples should facilitate research across a wide range of community- and population-based settings on seroprevalence, predictors and duration of antibody responses, as well as correlates of protection from reinfection, each of which is critically important for pandemic control.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.28.20081844v1.full.pdf

As many federal and state governments are starting to ease restrictions on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) used to flatten the curve, we developed an agent-based simulation to model the incidence of COVID-19 in King County, WA under several scenarios. While NPIs were effective in flattening the curve, any relaxation of social distancing strategies yielded a second wave.

COVID-19 is a novel threat to human health worldwide. There is an urgent need to understand patient characteristics of having COVID-19 disease and evaluate markers of critical illness and mortality. Objective: To assess association of clinical features on patient outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this observational case series, patient-level data were extracted from electronic medical records for 28,336 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 at the Mount Sinai Health System from 2/24/ to 4/15/2020, including 6,158 laboratory-confirmed cases. Exposures: Confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis by RT-PCR assay from nasal swabs. Main Outcomes and Measures: Effects of race on positive test rates and mortality were assessed. Among positive cases admitted to the hospital (N = 3,273), effects of patient demographics, hospital site and unit, social behavior, vital signs, lab results, and disease comorbidities on discharge and death were estimated. Results: Hispanics (29%) and African Americans (25%) had disproportionately high positive case rates relative to population base rates (p<2e-16); however, no differences in mortality rates were observed in the hospital. Outcome differed significantly between hospitals (Gray's T=248.9; p<2e-16), reflecting differences in average baseline age and underlying comorbidities. Significant risk factors for mortality included age (HR=1.05 [95% CI, 1.04-1.06]; p=1.15e-32), oxygen saturation (HR=0.985 [95% CI, 0.982-0.988]; p=1.57e-17), care in ICU areas (HR=1.58 [95% CI, 1.29-1.92]; p=7.81e-6), and elevated creatinine (HR=1.75 [95% CI, 1.47-2.10]; p=7.48e-10), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (HR=1.002, [95% CI 1.001-1.003]; p=8.86e-5) and body-mass index (BMI) (HR=1.02, [95% CI 1.00-1.03]; p=1.09e-2). Asthma (HR=0.78 [95% CI, 0.62-0.98]; p=0.031) was significantly associated with increased length of hospital stay, but not mortality. Deceased patients were more likely to have elevated markers of inflammation. Baseline age, BMI, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine, and ALT were significant prognostic indicators of mortality. Conclusions and Relevance: While race was associated with higher risk of infection, we did not find a racial disparity in inpatient mortality suggesting that outcomes in a single tertiary care health system are comparable across races. We identified clinical features associated with reduced mortality and discharge. These findings could help to identify which COVID-19 patients are at greatest risk and evaluate the impact on survival.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.28.20075788v1.full.pdf

Background: Evidence has emerged showing that elderly people and those with pre-existing chronic health conditions may be at higher risk of developing severe health consequences from COVID-19. In Europe, this is of particular relevance with ageing populations living with non-communicable diseases, multi-morbidity and frailty. Published estimates of Years Lived with Disability (YLD) from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study help to characterise the extent of these effects. Our aim was to identify the countries across Europe that have populations at highest risk from COVID-19 by using estimates of population age structure and YLD for health conditions linked to severe illness from COVID-19. Methods: Population and YLD estimates from GBD 2017 were extracted for 45 countries in Europe. YLD was restricted to a list of specific health conditions associated with being at risk of developing severe consequences from COVID-19 based on guidance from the United Kingdom Government. This guidance also identified individuals aged 70 years and above as being at higher risk of developing severe health consequences. Study outcomes were defined as: (i) proportion of population aged 70 years and above; and (ii) rate of YLD for COVID-19 for vulnerable health conditions across all ages. Bivariate groupings were established for each outcome and combined to establish overall population-level vulnerability. Results: Countries with the highest proportions of elderly residents were Italy, Greece, Germany, Portugal and Finland. When assessments of population-level YLD rates for COVID-19 vulnerable health conditions were made the highest rates were observed for Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Croatia, Hungary and Bosnia and Herzegovina. A bivariate analysis indicated that the countries at high-risk across both measures of vulnerability were: Bulgaria; Portugal; Latvia; Lithuania; Greece; Germany; Estonia; and Sweden. Conclusion: Routine estimates of population structures and non-fatal burden of disease measures can be usefully combined to create composite indicators of vulnerability for rapid assessments, in this case to severe health consequences from COVID-19. Countries with available results for sub-national regions within their country, or national burden of disease studies that also use sub-national levels for burden quantifications, should consider using non-fatal burden of disease estimates to estimate geographical vulnerability to COVID-19.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.29.20064279v1.full.pdf

Background: To increase bed capacity and resources, hospitals have postponed elective surgeries, although the financial impact of this decision is unknown. We sought to report elective surgical case distribution, associated gross hospital earnings and regional hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity as elective surgical cases are cancelled and then resumed under simulated trends of COVID-19 incidence. Methods: A retrospective, cohort analysis was performed using insurance claims from 161 million enrollees from the MarketScan database from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2017. COVID-19 cases were calculated using a generalized Richards model. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reports on the number of hospitalized and intensive care patients by age were used to estimate the number of cases seen in the ICU, the reduction in elective surgeries and the financial impact of this from historic claims data, using a denominator of all inpatient revenue and outpatient surgeries. Results: Assuming 5% infection prevalence, cancelling all elective procedures decreases ICU overcapacity from 340% to 270%, but these elective surgical cases contribute 78% (IQR 74, 80) (1.1 trillion (T) US dollars) to inpatient hospital plus outpatient surgical gross earnings per year. Musculoskeletal, circulatory and digestive category elective surgical cases compose 33% ($447B) of total revenue. Conclusions: Procedures involving the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular and digestive system account for the largest loss of hospital gross earnings when elective surgery is postponed. As hospital bed capacity increases following the COVID-19 pandemic, restoring volume of these elective cases will help maintain revenue.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.29.20066506v1.full.pdf

Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly worldwide and seriously threatens human health since December 2019. However, information about acute kidney injury (AKI) during COVID-19 infection is limited. Some studies thought that presence of AKI is very common and cannot be ignored, while some studies pointed that AKI only is a rare incident during COVID-19 infection. This meta-analysis aimed to find out the truth of COVID-19 related AKI and to provide stronger evidence. Methods: Two authors independently performed a literature search using PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library fulfilled the pre-specified criteria until April 25, 2020 to include studies reported the necessary clinic characteristics, then the incidence of AKI, incidence of required RRT, the mortality with AKI and the death risk with AKI during COVID-19 infection were pooled for statistical analysis by Open Meta-Analyst software to get conclusions. Findings: It was found that the incidence of AKI in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection is low, only about 3.8%; the in-hospital mortality with AKI in COVID-19 infected patients is reach up to 32.6%; the death risk with AKI in COVID-19 infected patients is about 16.1 times higher than those without AKI. Conclusions: This meta-analysis indicated AKI during COVID-19 infection should be pay more attention, it maybe a strong red flag to death risk. It is still need additional studies to support the conclusions and to explore the AKI mechanism during COVID-19 infection.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.29.20079038v1.full.pdf

Tocilizumab is used for treating moderate-severe Covid-19 pneumonia by targeting IL-6 receptors (IL-6R) and reducing cytokine release, but the pooled rate ratio among diabetic patients with adverse vs those with the more favorable course was 2.26. To date, the hyperglycemia has been shown to increase IL-6 and IL-6R, which has been suggested as a severity predictor in lung diseases of Covid-19 patients. However, there are no data about the effects of tocilizumab therapy on outcomes of hyperglycemic Covid-19 patients with pneumonia. To investigate this unsolved need, 475 Covid-19 positive patients were retrospectively studied since March 1st, 2020. Among them, 78 patients with pneumonia disease and treated with tocilizumab were further evaluated for a severe outcome (encompassing both the use of mechanical ventilation and/or death). Thirty-one (39.7%) hyperglycemic and 47 (60.3%) normoglycemic Covid-19 positive patients (blood glucose levels >140 mg/dl, at admission and/or during hospital stay) were evaluated. Noteworthy, 20 (64%) of hyperglycemic and 11 (23.4%) of normoglycemic patients were also diabetics (P<0.01). At admission, more elevated IL-6 levels in hyperglycemic patients were found and persists even after Tocilizumab administration. In a risk adjusted Cox-regression analysis, Tocilizumab in hyperglycemic did not attenuate the risks of severe outcome as did in normoglycemic patients (p<0.009). Therefore, we could conclude that reduced effects of Tocilizumab in hyperglycemic patients may due to the higher plasma IL-6 levels. Interestingly, when we added IL-6 levels in a Cox regression model the significance for the tocilizumab effect was lost (p<0.07). In this context, our observations evidence that optimal Covid-19 infection management with tocilizumab is not achieved during hyperglycemia both in diabetic and non-diabetic patients.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.29.20076570v1.full.pdf

The sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests developed by Charite (Germany), HKU (Hong-Kong), China CDC (China), US CDC (United-States), and Institut Pasteur, Paris (France) was assessed on SARS-CoV-2 cell culture supernatants and clinical samples. Although all RT-PCR assays performed well for SARS-CoV-2 detection, RdRp Institut Pasteur (IP2, IP4), N China CDC, and N1 US CDC were found to be the most sensitive.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.03.20072207v1.full.pdf

We design a procedure (the complete Python code may be obtained at: https://github.com/abhishta91/antibody\_montecarlo) using Monte Carlo (MC) simulation to establish the point estimators described below and confidence intervals for the base rate of occurrence of an attribute (e.g., antibodies against Covid-19) in an aggregate population (e.g., medical care workers) based on a test. The requirements for the procedure are the test's sample size (N) and total number of positives (X), and the data on test's reliability. The modus is the prior which generates the largest frequency of observations in the MC simulation with precisely the number of test positives (maximum-likelihood estimator). The median is the upper bound of the set of priors accounting for half of the total relevant observations in the MC simulation with numbers of positives identical to the test's number of positives. Our rather preliminary findings are: The median and the confidence intervals suffice universally; The estimator X/N may be outside of the two-sided 95% confidence interval; Conditions such that the modus, the median and another promising estimator which takes the reliability of the test into account, are quite close; Conditions such that the modus and the latter estimator must be regarded as logically inconsistent; Conditions inducing rankings among various estimators relevant for issues concerning over- or underestimation.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.28.20075036v1.full.pdf

In response to the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has rapidly issued 49 emergency use authorizations (EUAs) for SARS-CoV-2 in vitro diagnostic test-kits. A critical metric in the performance evaluation for a diagnostic test kit is the analytical sensitivity, which is measured by the limit of detection (LOD). Commercial RNA stocks with known titers are used to determine LOD. We identified a problem with the titer reported for the commercial stocks when examining the analytical sensitivity of the reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) protocol that is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) using plasmid DNA from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT), synthetic RNA from BEI Resources (BEI), and extracted genomic RNA from BEI. We detected 3/3 positives for reactions containing synthetic RNA at a concentration of 0.1 copies/reaction (based on the supplier's label concentration). The apparent better-than-single-molecule performance is a statistically highly unlikely event, indicating a potential inaccuracy in the supplier's quantification of the stock material. Using an ultrasensitive and precise assay, reverse transcription digital PCR (RT-dPCR), we independently quantified concentrations of commercial SARS-CoV-2 plasmid DNA and SARS-CoV-2 RNA stocks. For plasmid DNA, the actual concentration measured by RT-dPCR was 11% of the nominal label concentration. For synthetic RNA, the actual concentration measured by RT-dPCR for one lot was 770% of the label concentration and for a different lot was 57% of the label concentration. For genomic RNA, the concentration measured by RT-dPCR for one lot was 240% of the label concentration and for a different lot it was 300% of the label concentration. This SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA from BEI Resources has been used in at least 11 approved FDA Emergency Use Authorizations as of April 27, 2020. Such deviations of reported RNA or DNA stock concentrations from true concentrations can result in inaccurate quantification and calculation of LOD. Precise and accurate reporting of DNA and RNA stock concentrations by commercial suppliers will enable accurate quantification of assay performance, which is urgently needed to improve evaluation of different assays by diagnostic developers and regulatory bodies.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.28.20077602v1.full.pdf

SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) is mainly transmitted in the human population during close contact and respiratory droplets. It is currently unclear, however, whether CoV-2 is shed into milk and may also be transmitted from infected mothers to newborns trough breast feeding. Two recent reviews on the topic (1,2) did not find evidence for CoV-2 in human milk. However, the number of breast milk samples analyzed so far is small and samples were taken only once from each mother (2).",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.28.20075523v1.full.pdf

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) affecting across the globe. The government of different countries has adopted various policies to contain this epidemic and the most common were social distancing and lockdown. We use a simple log-linear model with intercept and trend break to evaluate whether the measures are effective preventing/slowing down the spread of the disease in Turkey. We estimate the model parameters from the Johns Hopkins University (2020) epidemic data between 15th March and 16th April 2020. Our analysis revealed that the measures can slow down the outbreak. We can reduce the epidemic size and prolong the time to arrive at the epidemic peak by seriously following the measures suggested by the authorities.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.28.20083550v1.full.pdf

Background: As the number of COVID-19 cases in the US continues to rise and hospitals are experiencing personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages, healthcare workers have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 infection. Since COVID-19 testing is now available, some have raised the question of whether we should be routinely testing asymptomatic healthcare workers. Methods: Using publicly available data on COVID-19 infections and emergency department visits, as well as internal hospital staffing information, we generated a mathematical model to predict the impact of periodic COVID-19 testing in asymptomatic members of the emergency department staff in regions affected by COVID-19 infection. We calculated various transmission constants based on the Diamond Princess cruise ship data, used a logistic model to calculate new infections, and we created a Markov model according to average COVID-19 incubation time. Results: Our model predicts that after 30 days, with a transmission constant of 1.219e-4 new infections per person2, weekly COVID-19 testing of healthcare workers (HCW) would reduce new HCW and patient infections by 5.1% and bi-weekly testing would reduce both by 2.3%. At a transmission constant of 3.660e-4 new infections per person,2 weekly testing would reduce infections by 21.1% and bi-weekly testing would reduce infections by 9.7-9.8%. For a lower transmission constant of 4.067e-5 new infections per person2, weekly and biweekly HCW testing would result in a 1.54% and 0.7% reduction in infections respectively. Conclusion: Periodic COVID-19 testing for emergency department staff in regions that are heavily-affected by COVID-19 and/or facing resource constraints may reduce COVID-19 transmission significantly among healthcare workers and previously-uninfected patients.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.28.20084053v1.full.pdf
